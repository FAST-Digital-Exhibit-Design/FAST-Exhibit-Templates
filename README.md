# FAST Exhibit Templates

Three exhibit experience templates that allow museum professionals to 
create their own FAST tables without having to start from the beginning.

**What is FAST?**

<ins>F</ins>lexible, <ins>A</ins>ccessible <ins>S</ins>trategies for <ins>T</ins>imely Digital Exhibit Design

Museums play a critical role in engaging their communities around urgent 
issues that emerge in the public sphere. However, typical exhibit development 
timelines can stretch for years, and "what's new" can change swiftly before 
an exhibition is even launched. What if museums could stay agile and dynamic, 
changing out content as community needs shift, science progresses, and the 
world changes? What if timely exhibit offerings could be not just efficiently 
produced, but accessible and welcoming to all visitors? This vision of 
efficiency and accessibility is at the center of FAST.
