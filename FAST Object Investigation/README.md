## Documentation

The sample experience included in a release package is preconfigured with 
the settings needed to run the interactive. The following subsections are 
for reference if you want to customize the settings, make a new skin, or 
modify the software.

### Changing Activity Settings

1. Navigate to the **Assets** folder
2. Open *SkinName*-**settings.xml**, such as **Geology-settings.xml**
3. For information about each setting, see 
[FAST SDK Reference Documentation](https://FAST-Digital-Exhibit-Design.github.io/FAST-SDK-Documentation/class_f_a_s_t_1_1_base_settings.html)

### Changing Tangible Object Settings

1. Navigate to the **Assets** folder
2. Open *SkinName*-**Object-settings.xml**, such as **Geology-Object-settings.xml**
3. The `<Object>` settings define the Tangible Objects. The top-down 
order of each `<Object>` will determine the order they are used in the 
activity as a teaser.
    - The `name` must match the same name used in asset files.
4. The `<MaximumNumberOfGuesses>` setting defines the number of times a 
teaser can be guessed incorrectly before it is skipped and the activity 
moves on to the next teaser.

### Changing Marker Tracking Settings

1. Navigate to the **Assets** folder
2. Open *SkinName*-**MarkerTracking-settings.xml**, such as **Geology-MarkerTracking-settings.xml**
3. The `<UdpConnectionId>` setting defines the name of the UDP 
connection to use. Don't change this value unless you are editing the 
source code because the application is compiled with a UDP connection 
set to this name. The default value should be 
`<UdpConnectionId>Computer Vision</UdpConnectionId>`.
4. The `<MaximumNumberOfMarkers>` setting defines the maximum number of 
number of unique IDs in the marker set that can possibly be detected. 
This value should match the *Dictionary Size* parameter in the 
[FAST Computer Vision](https://github.com/FAST-Digital-Exhibit-Design/FAST-Computer-Vision/blob/main/fast-computer-vision/doc/UserManual.md) 
application.

### Adding a New Skin

1. Navigate to the **Assets** folder
2. Copy the folder containing the assets for the new skin
3. Navigate to the **root** folder where the application is installed
4. Open **config.xml** and change `<skin>Geology</skin>` to the name of 
your new skin
